Web Assessment:

What did you like about this project?
It was challenging compared to previous exercises. This project highlighted my lack of understanding in certain concepts. As I went to search on the different issues I encountered, I learnt more, which made it more fulfilling.


What did you struggle with in this project?
The main few areas in which I struggled with were:
	- sizing of nested flex boxes (including images and vid) & how this is affected when it is in mobile view
	- tidying of CSS styling: I tried to create a common flex box style at the top but I realised when trying to replace it in the different sections, some of the styles run. 
	- speed: The estimated time allocated was 5hrs. I took way longer than that hahah


What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I'm not too sure if feedback will be given after the grading of this assessment but I would appreciate if feedback can be given on the areas I am lacking in.

Thank you! :)
